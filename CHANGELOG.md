# Release 1.1.3-jdk-11

## Release Highlights

* upgrade Postgresql dependency
* upgrade H2 dependency
* upgrade rd-lib-common dependency

## Important Notes

* Known Issue: when you have two tables with identical name in different schema, imported as Database connection in your
  benerator script ( for example: tableA in schema1 as db connection id="db1"
  and tableA in schema2 as dbconnection id="db2" ), the framework won't be able to identify the right table when it
  comes to persisting entities to Database.

## Breaking Changes

* removed __includeTables="#all"__ tag, this is not necessary anymore, because the is a mechanism to identify related
  schema automatically based on JDBC metadata.
